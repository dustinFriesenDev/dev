## My process

I started with HTML structure and added CSS from top down following the HTML flow. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that there is a need for both flexbox and margin for centering content. I couldn't get everything to align properly with flexbox alone and had to use text-align and margins.

### Continued development

Learning mobile first workflow.
